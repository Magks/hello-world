"The sun knew not
Where her hall she had;
The moon knew not
What might he had;
The stars knew not
Their resting-places."

-- Snorri Sturluson, The Prose Edda, IV.8 "The Creation of the the World" c. 1220

Fragile and flexible the vagaries of conception, but indelible are the essences underlying any beginning. Often most of the journey is the unveiling and reclamation of the original foundation. 

-- "The Soft Wrap, O Captain, O Muse"
